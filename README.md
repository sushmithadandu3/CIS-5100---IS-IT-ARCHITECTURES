# CIS-5100---IS-IT-ARCHITECTURES

**Project Overview**

The primary goal of this report is to discuss the challenges of employment caused by 
automation in this modern world. This report aims to identify the effects of automation in the 
field of computers and industries, the link between automation and society, the challenges 
associated with robotization, and their impact.


The link between automation and its impact on employment is an unnoticed issue since 
automation is widely seen as a positive aspect due to technological progress and its advantageâ€™s. 
It accelerates manufacturing, improves the quality of products, speed of process and allows for a 
higher level of stability. However, the societal influence and the impacts on industries are not 
widely considered. This is the reason we found this topic interesting to bring out the facts with 
available resources. 


This report will review the findings of current studies on the issue and address significant 
facts.
